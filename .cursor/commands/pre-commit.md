I’m about to commit the code. Before that, please do the following checks:

- Carefully review all recent code changes to verify they are intentional and correct.
- Make sure the documentation is fully updated to cover any new or changed features.
- Remove all temporary files, debug leftovers, and any processing artifacts.
- Clean up redundant comments and console or debug statements.
- Check the overall project structure and ensure coding styles are consistent.
- Run a full build of the project to confirm it completes without errors or warnings.
